# taekwondo-companion
I had some problems learning the words for taekwondo (Im spanish, living in germany, and with the accent sometimes I understood another technique as intended). So, to help me, I did this little website.

The first version was done only for me, so right now IÂ´m using the images that were in some images and PDFs that I could find in spanish to help me learn the words correctly. But with time, I want to change those for animated gifs showing better the moves.

NOTE: 11.02.2021 - This project is dead. I wanted to make my own graphics for this and addmore features (like a filter after belt colour, asking for the next step of a kata/form to help learn the sequences, etc...) But I had no time and right now this is very dead, there are other things/Projects I want to make and I dont think I will keep doing this (I havent done anything in 2 years or so).
