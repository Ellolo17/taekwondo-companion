# taekwondo-companion
I had some problems learning the words for taekwondo (Im spanish, living in germany, and with the accent sometimes I understood another technique as intended). So, to help me, I did this little website.

The first version was done only for me, so right now IÂ´m using the images that were in some images and PDFs that I could find in spanish to help me learn the words correctly. But with time, I want to change those for animated gifs showing better the moves.

Next steps:
-Apply the filters. Right now the changes are only stetic.
-Add poomsae questions
-implement translation because right now the names are adapted to spanish, and not to english or german.
